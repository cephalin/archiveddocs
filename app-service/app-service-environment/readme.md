# App Service environment documentation
 Azure App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale. This capability can host your [web apps][webapps], [mobile apps][mobileapps], [API apps][APIApps], and [functions][Functions].

App Service environments (ASEs) are ideal for application workloads that require:

* Very high scale.
* Isolation and secure network access.

Customers can create multiple ASEs within a single Azure region and across multiple Azure regions. This versatility makes ASEs ideal for horizontally scaling stateless application tiers in support of high RPS workloads.

ASEs are isolated to running only a single customer's applications and are always deployed into an Azure virtual network. Customers have fine-grained control over inbound and outbound application network traffic by using [Network Security Groups][NSGs]. Applications can also establish high-speed secure connections over virtual networks to on-premises corporate resources.

Apps frequently need to access corporate resources, such as internal databases and web services. Apps that run on ASEs can access resources via [site-to-site][SiteToSite] VPN and [Azure ExpressRoute][ExpressRoute] connections.
